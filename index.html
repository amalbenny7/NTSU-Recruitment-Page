                <p>Looking for a job alongside your studies? Head over to our Student Jobs page to check out our current student vacancies!</p>
                <p>Nottingham Trent Students' Union is one of the largest, most active Students' Unions within the UK. We're here to make sure NTU students get the most out of university life through state-of-the-art venues, a diverse entertainment programme, support, representation, and more. We have a highly engaged student community and each day, our priorities are shaped by our student population. As a union, we employ over 300 students and 60 career staff, speaking over 20 languages.</p>
                <p>In recent years, some of our biggest internal focuses have been on our people & culture, the environment, and learning and development. Since 2022, we have achieved an EcoCampus Silver Accreditation, an 'Excellent' Status as a Green Impact Students' Union, and are now diverting 97% of our in-house waste from landfill. Most of our Sustainability work is driven through our Sustainability Advisory Group, made up of employees from every level and department within the organisation, from senior leadership to student staff, and key external stakeholders. Our goal is to be Net Zero by 2040.</p>
                <p>Every day we actively work to be a more inclusive employer with a welcoming and supportive culture. As an Equal Opportunities and Disability Confident Employer, NTSU welcomes applications from all suitably qualified candidates regardless of your race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation, or age.</p>
                <p>Due to the high number of applications some of our roles receive, we are unable to provide feedback on applications that have not proceeded to the Interview Stage.</p>
                <p>We appreciate everyone who has shown interest in working with us and took the time and effort to submit an application, and we always strive to respond to each application. Unfortunately, if you have not heard back from us within 4 weeks of the closing date, your application has been unsuccessful this time.</p>

                <h2>Who Are We</h2>
                <p>Part business, part charity — students’ unions are serious fun places to work. They are organisations in their own right. Professional teams support elected student leaders to make change, improve lives and fulfill potential, we help make it happen.</p>
                <p>Nottingham Trent Students’ Union (NTSU) is one of more than 550 students' unions across the country. With more than 40,000 members, 300 student staff and 60 career staff, along with a huge range of services across multiple campuses, we are one of the biggest. We offer an advice centre, representation, student groups and much more. Professionally run, but different.</p>
